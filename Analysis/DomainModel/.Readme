Domain Model — SCFMS Room Booking SystemThe domain model for the Smart Campus Facility Management System (SCFMS) defines the core structural blueprint of the Room Booking System. It identifies eight key domain classes, their attributes, and the relationships between them, forming the conceptual foundation upon which the entire system is built. The implementation language for this project is Java, and all classes are designed following Object-Oriented Design principles.System OverviewSCFMS is a student-centered platform that allows university students to book campus rooms, check in to reservations, submit maintenance tickets for facility issues, and authenticate securely through a credential system. The domain model captures all of these real-world interactions as structured classes and typed relationships, providing a clear and unambiguous design reference for development.
