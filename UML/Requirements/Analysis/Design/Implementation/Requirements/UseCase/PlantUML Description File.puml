' Actor Notes (1 paragraph each)

note right of Student
Student is a primary actor who uses SCFMS+ to search for available rooms, create bookings, and perform QR check-in to confirm real usage of a reserved space. Students also cancel bookings when needed, check out and return equipment, and submit maintenance tickets when something is broken, while tracking ticket status to stay informed about progress and resolution.
end note

note right of Staff
Staff represents faculty and campus employees who book rooms for classes, meetings, and events and may also use equipment checkout for instructional needs. Staff actors interact with the same booking and maintenance features as students, relying on accurate availability, fast alternatives when conflicts occur, and timely updates when issues are reported and fixed.
end note

note right of Technician
Technician is responsible for maintenance execution and uses SCFMS+ to receive assigned work orders, update progress through the ticket lifecycle, and resolve reported issues. This role ensures repairs are tracked consistently, recorded with resolution information, and completed efficiently so rooms and assets return to operational status quickly.
end note

note right of Admin
Admin is a privileged actor who manages the system configuration and resources, including rooms, assets, policies, and analytics. Admin oversees operational governance by configuring grace-period rules and other policies, assigning work orders, and reviewing dashboards to improve utilization, reduce downtime, and support planning decisions.

' Use Case Notes (1 paragraph each)

note right of UC1
Search Available Rooms allows users to find rooms based on constraints such as time range, capacity, and required features (for example projector or whiteboard). The system filters results using current reservations and room metadata to provide an accurate list of available options, reducing manual searching and preventing scheduling conflicts.
end note

note right of UC2
Book Room creates a reservation for a selected room and time slot after validating availability and policy constraints. The system stores the reservation to prevent double booking and can trigger confirmation messages so the user has a reliable record of the reservation and the room is reserved for that time period.
end note

note right of UC3
Get Alternative Room Recommendations helps users quickly recover from booking conflicts by suggesting the best-fitting alternatives. The system ranks available rooms using factors such as capacity match, required equipment, preferred location, and scheduling constraints so the user can choose an optimal option without repeating the entire search process.
end note

note right of UC4
QR Check-In verifies that a reserved room is actually being used by the booking party at the start of the reservation window. The user scans a QR code within a configured grace period, which activates the reservation and supports fairness by enabling automatic handling of no-shows when check-in does not occur.
end note

note right of UC5
Cancel Booking allows users to cancel an existing reservation according to campus rules and timing constraints. When a booking is cancelled, the system releases the room so others can reserve it and records the cancellation for auditing and analytics such as tracking no-show or cancellation patterns.
end note

note right of UC6
Check Out Equipment enables users to borrow equipment (such as projectors, microphones, or lab kits) linked to inventory and availability. The system records who checked out the asset and when, supporting accountability and ensuring equipment is allocated fairly and tracked across its usage history.
end note

note right of UC7
Return Equipment closes the checkout cycle by recording the return time and optionally the condition of the asset. This updates inventory availability immediately, helps identify damaged or failing equipment, and ensures the next user can access the item without uncertainty about its status.
end note

note right of UC8
Submit Maintenance Ticket lets users report issues related to a room or asset by providing details such as category, priority, and a description of the problem. The system creates a trackable ticket and stores history that supports operational response as well as longer-term maintenance analytics and prevention.
end note

note right of UC9
Track Ticket Status allows users, technicians, and administrators to see the current state of a ticket (for example Open, In Progress, or Resolved) and follow updates over time. This reduces repeated inquiries and improves transparency by making progress visible and enabling notifications when status changes.
end note

note right of UC10
Assign Work Order converts a ticket into an actionable maintenance task and assigns responsibility to a technician, often with a due date or priority-based scheduling. This use case formalizes ownership and workflow so maintenance work is distributed efficiently and tracked until completion.
end note

note right of UC11
Resolve Ticket is performed by technicians to confirm that the reported issue has been fixed and the room or asset is operational. The system records resolution notes and timestamps, closes the loop for stakeholders, and preserves the event as historical data for reporting and future risk analysis.
end note

note right of UC12
Manage Rooms & Assets allows administrators to add, update, and maintain room and equipment information such as capacity, features, location, and asset attributes. Accurate metadata is essential because booking availability, recommendations, and maintenance tracking depend on correct definitions of rooms and assets.
end note

note right of UC13
View Analytics Dashboard provides administrators with operational insights such as utilization trends, peak usage periods, cancellation/no-show patterns, common failure categories, and average resolution time. These metrics support data-driven improvements to scheduling policies, budgeting, staffing, and long-term planning.
end note

note right of UC14
Configure Policies (Grace Period, Rules) allows administrators to define the business rules that govern system behavior, such as check-in grace periods, cancellation rules, restricted-room constraints, and notification preferences. Centralized policy configuration ensures consistent enforcement across the platform and allows the system to adapt to campus needs.
