SCFMS is an innovative object-oriented campus facility system that combines room booking, equipment checkout, and maintenance into one smart workflow. Unlike basic reservation apps, it uses QR-based check-in to verify real room usage (and automatically releases no-show bookings), a smart recommendation engine that suggests the best alternative rooms when conflicts happen, and a predictive maintenance score that flags rooms/equipment likely to fail soon based on historical issues. The system serves students and staff who need reliable spaces, technicians who handle repairs, and administrators who want data-driven decisions. The design is built around strong OOP modeling (Users, Rooms, Reservations, Assets, Tickets, WorkOrders) and extensible components (strategies, states, observers) so new policies and features can be added without rewriting the system.
